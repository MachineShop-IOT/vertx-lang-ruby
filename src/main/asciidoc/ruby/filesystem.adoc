== Using the file system with Vert.x

The Vert.x `link:yardoc/Vertx/FileSystem.html[FileSystem]` object provides many operations for manipulating the file system.

There is one file system object per Vert.x instance, and you obtain it with  `link:yardoc/Vertx/Vertx.html#file_system-instance_method[fileSystem]`.

A blocking and a non blocking version of each operation is provided. The non blocking versions take a handler
which is called when the operation completes or an error occurs.

Here's an example of an asynchronous copy of a file:

[source,ruby]
----
fs = vertx.file_system()

# Copy file from foo.txt to bar.txt
fs.copy("foo.txt", "bar.txt") { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    # Copied ok!
  else
    # Something went wrong
  end
}

----
The blocking versions are named `xxxBlocking` and return the results or throw exceptions directly. In many
cases, depending on the operating system and file system, some of the potentially blocking operations can return
quickly, which is why we provide them, but it's highly recommended that you test how long they take to return in your
particular application before using them from an event loop, so as not to break the Golden Rule.

Here's the copy using the blocking API:

[source,ruby]
----
fs = vertx.file_system()

# Copy file from foo.txt to bar.txt synchronously
fs.copy_blocking("foo.txt", "bar.txt")

----

Many operations exist to copy, move, truncate, chmod and many other file operations. We won't list them all here,
please consult the `link:yardoc/Vertx/FileSystem.html[API docs]` for the full list.

Let's see a couple of examples using asynchronous methods:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx/vertx'
require 'vertx/buffer'
vertx = Vertx::Vertx.vertx()

# Read a file
vertx.file_system().read_file("target/classes/readme.txt") { |result_err,result|
  if (result_err == nil)
    puts result
  else
    STDERR.puts "Oh oh ...#{result_err}"
  end
}

# Copy a file
vertx.file_system().copy("target/classes/readme.txt", "target/classes/readme2.txt") { |result_err,result|
  if (result_err == nil)
    puts "File copied"
  else
    STDERR.puts "Oh oh ...#{result_err}"
  end
}

# Write a file
vertx.file_system().write_file("target/classes/hello.txt", Vertx::Buffer.buffer("Hello")) { |result_err,result|
  if (result_err == nil)
    puts "File written"
  else
    STDERR.puts "Oh oh ...#{result_err}"
  end
}

# Check existence and delete
vertx.file_system().exists("target/classes/junk.txt") { |result_err,result|
  if (result_err == nil && result)
    vertx.file_system().delete("target/classes/junk.txt") { |r_err,r|
      puts "File deleted"
    }
  else
    STDERR.puts "Oh oh ... - cannot delete the file: #{result_err}"
  end
}

----

=== Asynchronous files

Vert.x provides an asynchronous file abstraction that allows you to manipulate a file on the file system.

You open an `link:yardoc/Vertx/AsyncFile.html[AsyncFile]` as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
options = {
}
fileSystem.open("myfile.txt", options) { |res_err,res|
  if (res_err == nil)
    file = res
  else
    # Something went wrong!
  end
}

----

`AsyncFile` implements `ReadStream` and `WriteStream` so you can _pump_
files to and from other stream objects such as net sockets, http requests and responses, and WebSockets.

They also allow you to read and write directly to them.

==== Random access writes

To use an `AsyncFile` for random access writing you use the
`link:yardoc/Vertx/AsyncFile.html#write-instance_method[write]` method.

The parameters to the method are:

* `buffer`: the buffer to write.
* `position`: an integer position in the file where to write the buffer. If the position is greater or equal to the size
 of the file, the file will be enlarged to accommodate the offset.
* `handler`: the result handler

Here is an example of random access writes:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx/vertx'
require 'vertx/buffer'
vertx = Vertx::Vertx.vertx()
vertx.file_system().open("target/classes/hello.txt", {
}) { |result_err,result|
  if (result_err == nil)
    file = result
    buff = Vertx::Buffer.buffer("foo")
    i = 0
    while (i < 5)
      file.write(buff, buff.length() * i) { |ar_err,ar|
        if (ar_err == nil)
          puts "Written ok!"
          # etc
        else
          STDERR.puts "Failed to write: #{ar_err}"
        end
      }
      i+=1
    end
  else
    STDERR.puts "Cannot open file #{result_err}"
  end
}

----

==== Random access reads

To use an `AsyncFile` for random access reads you use the
`link:yardoc/Vertx/AsyncFile.html#read-instance_method[read]`
method.

The parameters to the method are:

* `buffer`: the buffer into which the data will be read.
* `offset`: an integer offset into the buffer where the read data will be placed.
* `position`: the position in the file where to read data from.
* `length`: the number of bytes of data to read
* `handler`: the result handler

Here's an example of random access reads:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx/vertx'
require 'vertx/buffer'
vertx = Vertx::Vertx.vertx()
vertx.file_system().open("target/classes/les_miserables.txt", {
}) { |result_err,result|
  if (result_err == nil)
    file = result
    buff = Vertx::Buffer.buffer(1000)
    i = 0
    while (i < 10)
      file.read(buff, i * 100, i * 100, 100) { |ar_err,ar|
        if (ar_err == nil)
          puts "Read ok!"
        else
          STDERR.puts "Failed to write: #{ar_err}"
        end
      }
      i+=1
    end
  else
    STDERR.puts "Cannot open file #{result_err}"
  end
}

----

==== Opening Options

When opening an `AsyncFile`, you pass an `link:../cheatsheet/OpenOptions.html[OpenOptions]` instance.
These options describe the behavior of the file access. For instance, you can configure the file permissions with the
`link:../cheatsheet/OpenOptions.html#read[read]`, `link:../cheatsheet/OpenOptions.html#write[write]`
and `link:../cheatsheet/OpenOptions.html#perms[perms]` methods.

You can also configure the behavior if the open file already exists with
`link:../cheatsheet/OpenOptions.html#createNew[createNew]` and
`link:../cheatsheet/OpenOptions.html#truncateExisting[truncateExisting]`.

You can also mark the file to be deleted on
close or when the JVM is shutdown with `link:../cheatsheet/OpenOptions.html#deleteOnClose[deleteOnClose]`.

==== Flushing data to underlying storage.

In the `OpenOptions`, you can enable/disable the automatic synchronisation of the content on every write using
`link:../cheatsheet/OpenOptions.html#dsync[dsync]`. In that case, you can manually flush any writes from the OS
cache by calling the `link:yardoc/Vertx/AsyncFile.html#flush-instance_method[flush]` method.

This method can also be called with an handler which will be called when the flush is complete.

==== Using AsyncFile as ReadStream and WriteStream

`AsyncFile` implements `ReadStream` and `WriteStream`. You can then
use them with a _pump_ to pump data to and from other read and write streams. For example, this would
copy the content to another `AsyncFile`:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'vertx/vertx'
require 'vertx/pump'
vertx = Vertx::Vertx.vertx()
output = vertx.file_system().open_blocking("target/classes/plagiary.txt", {
})

vertx.file_system().open("target/classes/les_miserables.txt", {
}) { |result_err,result|
  if (result_err == nil)
    file = result
    Vertx::Pump.pump(file, output).start()
    file.end_handler() { |r|
      puts "Copy done"
    }
  else
    STDERR.puts "Cannot open file #{result_err}"
  end
}

----

You can also use the _pump_ to write file content into HTTP responses, or more generally in any
`WriteStream`.

==== Closing an AsyncFile

To close an `AsyncFile` call the `link:yardoc/Vertx/AsyncFile.html#close-instance_method[close]` method. Closing is asynchronous and
if you want to be notified when the close has been completed you can specify a handler function as an argument.
